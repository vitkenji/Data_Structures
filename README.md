##  Requirements

Before running, make sure you have a C compiler installed, such as:
- **GCC** (Linux/macOS)
- **MinGW** (Windows)

You also need **Make**, which usually comes with the compiler or can be installed separately.

##  Running

From inside any data structure folder (for example, `Stack/`), run the following command:
- `make run` (Linux)
- `mingw32-make run` (Windows)
